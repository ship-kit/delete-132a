## DevTools

DevTools includes optional UI helpers that can be enabled during development to speed up UI iteration:

- Tailwind Indicator: shows current responsive breakpoint
- Font Selector: change fonts on the fly for visual testing
- Live Preview Script: optional external helper injected in the document head

### Enable

Add this to your environment (local only recommended):

```bash
ENABLE_DEVTOOLS=true
```

At build time, this sets `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_DEVTOOLS_ENABLED=true` which is used throughout the app.

### Where it appears

- App Router: `src/app/(app)/layout.tsx` injects the live-preview script when enabled
- App Router: `FontSelector` renders in development only when the flag is enabled
- App Router: `TailwindIndicator` renders in development only when the flag is enabled
- Pages Router: `_app.tsx` renders both `TailwindIndicator` and `FontSelector` in development when the flag is enabled

### Components

- `src/components/modules/devtools/tailwind-indicator.tsx`
- `src/components/modules/devtools/font-selector.tsx`

### Notes

- DevTools are disabled in production even if the flag is present
- Keep this flag off in production environments
