## How to Enable Integrations

Each integration is enabled by setting the required environment variables in your `.env.local` file (for development) or your deployment platform's environment settings (for production).

### Environment Variable Categories

- **Server Variables**: Used in API routes and server-side operations
- **Client Variables**: Exposed to the browser (prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`)
- **Optional Variables**: Enhance functionality but aren't required for basic operation

### Example Setup

```bash
# Payment processing
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...

# Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=phc_...

# Authentication
AUTH_SECRET=your_secret_here
AUTH_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

## Feature Flags

Many integrations automatically enable corresponding feature flags that control UI elements and functionality. These are managed automatically based on your environment variable configuration.

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit API keys or secrets to version control
- Use different keys for development and production
- Rotate keys regularly
- Monitor usage and set up alerts for unusual activity
- Follow the principle of least privilege for API permissions

## Support
