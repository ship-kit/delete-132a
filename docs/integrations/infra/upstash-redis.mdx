# Upstash Redis Integration

Upstash Redis is a serverless Redis service that provides a fully managed, scalable, and secure Redis database with a generous free tier.

## Environment Variables

### Required Server Variables
```
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-db-id.upstash.io # Your Upstash Redis REST URL
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_rest_token_here # Your Upstash Redis REST token
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create an Upstash Account**: Sign up at [upstash.com](https://upstash.com) if you haven't already

   - Create a new Redis database
   - Choose your region and plan

3. **Get Your Connection Details**:
   - In your database dashboard, go to "Connect"
   - Copy the REST URL and REST Token
   - These are used for HTTP-based Redis operations

4. **Add Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-db-id.upstash.io
   UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_rest_token_here
   ```

## Features Enabled

When these environment variables are configured, the following features become available:

- ✅ High-performance caching
- ✅ Session storage
- ✅ Rate limiting
- ✅ Job queues and background tasks
- ✅ Real-time data structures
- ✅ Pub/Sub messaging
- ✅ Data persistence and backup
- ✅ Automatic scaling

## Configuration Options

### Advanced Configuration
You can customize Redis behavior:

```bash
# Connection configuration
UPSTASH_REDIS_READ_TIMEOUT=3000
