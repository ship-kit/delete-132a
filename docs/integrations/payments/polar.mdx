# Polar

Open-source payment platform for developers.

```bash
POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_POLAR_SUBSCRIPTION_PRICE_ID=your_price_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_POLAR_ONE_TIME_PRICE_ID=your_price_id
```

Note:

- Polar client price IDs are not mirrored because they are already `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` and not derived from a single base key. Only specific whitelisted keys (Builder, Clerk publishable, Supabase URL/anon, Stripe publishable, analytics keys, C15T URL) are mirrored.
