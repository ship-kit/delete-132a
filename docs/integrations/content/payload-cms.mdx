# Payload CMS Integration

Payload CMS is now integrated into our main [Content Management guide](/docs/content-management). You'll find everything you need to get started with structured content management.

## Quick Setup

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/database
PAYLOAD_SECRET=randomsecretkey # Used for encrypting passwords and sessions
```

Payload CMS is automatically enabled when both `DATABASE_URL` and `PAYLOAD_SECRET` are provided. You can explicitly disable it by setting `DISABLE_PAYLOAD=true`.
