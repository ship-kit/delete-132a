# Builder.io Integration

Builder.io is now integrated into our main [Content Management guide](/docs/content-management). You'll find everything you need to get started with visual content creation.

## Quick Setup

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILDER_API_KEY=bldr_your_api_key_here
```

Note:

- You can set `BUILDER_API_KEY` without the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix and Shipkit will automatically generate `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILDER_API_KEY` at build time for use on the client.
- The non-prefixed variable is not accessible on the client; only the generated `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` value is exposed.

## Key Features

- ✅ Visual drag-and-drop page builder
- ✅ Component library integration
- ✅ A/B testing and personalization
- ✅ Real-time content editing
