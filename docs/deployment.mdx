# Deployment

Shipkit deploys beautifully on Vercel. One-click setup with all the performance optimizations you need.

## One-Click Deploy

The fastest way to get started:

1. **Click the Deploy button** in the README
2. **Connect your GitHub repo** to Vercel
3. **Add your environment variables**
4. **You're live!**

That's it. Shipkit handles the rest.

## Manual Deploy (Advanced)

For more control:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login to your account
vercel login

# Deploy your app
vercel deploy
```

## Environment Variables

Shipkit needs these to work properly:

1. **Copy the example file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

2. **Configure your services:**
   - Database (if using Payload CMS)
   - Authentication providers
   - Payment processors
   - Analytics services

3. **Add to Vercel:**
   - Go to your project dashboard
   - Add variables under "Environment Variables"
   - Set up different values for production/staging

## Built-in Features

Shipkit comes with Vercel optimizations:

- ✅ **Automatic HTTPS** - SSL certificates handled for you
- ✅ **Edge Functions** - Global CDN with fast responses
- ✅ **Analytics** - Built-in performance monitoring
- ✅ **Preview Deployments** - Test changes before merging
- ✅ **CI/CD** - Automatic deployments from Git

## Production Checklist

Before going live:

- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Domain connected (optional)
- [ ] Analytics enabled
- [ ] Error monitoring set up
- [ ] Performance tested

## Advanced Deployment

### Multi-Zone Setup
Run multiple Shipkit apps on different paths:

```typescript
// next.config.ts - Add rewrites for zones
async rewrites() {
  return [
    {
      source: '/docs/:path*',
      destination: 'https://docs.yourdomain.com/docs/:path*',
    },
    // Add more zones as needed
  ];
}
```

### Custom Domains
Point your domain to Vercel:

1. Add your domain in Vercel dashboard
2. Update DNS records as instructed
3. SSL certificate is automatic

## Troubleshooting

**Build failing?**
- Check environment variables are set
- Verify database connection
- Check for TypeScript errors

**Slow performance?**
- Enable Vercel's analytics
- Check image optimization
- Review bundle size
